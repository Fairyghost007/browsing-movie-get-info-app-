# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Movie List App

A React-based Movie List application where users can view a list of movies, filter them by title and rating, view detailed movie descriptions, and add new movies. 

## Features

- **Movie List**: View a list of movies with titles and ratings.
- **Filter**: Filter movies by title and rating (available only on the home page).
- **Add Movie**: Add new movies with title, rating, description, and trailer URL.
- **Movie Details**: View detailed information about a selected movie, including a description and embedded trailer.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Frontend library for building user interfaces.
- **React Router**: For routing between different pages (home, movie details).
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling the application with custom colors and themes.

## Customization
- You can add or change movie data in the Movies.js file in the Components folder.


## Custom Colors

This project uses a custom color palette defined in `tailwind.config.js`:

- `darkPurple`: `#141124`
- `lightPurple`: `#2F2B43`
- `palePurple`: `#393351`
- `purplle`: `#524A7B`
- `darkRose`: `#A868A0`
- `paleRose`: `#D4CEE3`, with opacity variants for different transparency levels

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie-list-app.git
   cd movie-list-app
   ```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
